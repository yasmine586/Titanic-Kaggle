# Titanic-Kaggle
Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster. This repository includes my notebooks and scripts for exploring the Titanic dataset, performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training machine learning models to predict passenger survival.
The goal is to predict passenger survival based on available features such as age, class, and gender.Best score: 0.78
## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `titanic_prediction.ipynb` â†’ Machine Learning models
- `submission.csv` â†’ My final predictions for Kaggle submission
The following machine learning models were tested to predict passenger survival:
## ðŸ“Š Models Used
- **GradientBoostingClassifier**
- **RandomForestClassifier**
- **LogisticRegression**
- **KNeighborsClassifier**
- **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)**
- **VotingClassifier (soft voting ensemble)** combining the above models for better performance.
## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values and scaling.
